This is a series of notes on machine learning. 
I initially took these notes while attending the [Coursera course on Machine Learning from Standford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
The course primary coding language is Octave (or Matlab), while I wanted to try the same excercises in Python.
I will probably enrich and expand upon the course original content in time, so that in the future these notes might diverge substantially from it.
