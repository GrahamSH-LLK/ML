# Machine Learning

This is a series of notes on machine learning. 
I took these notes primarily while attending the (Coursera course on Machine Learning from Standford University)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/]. 
The course primary coiding language is Octave (or Matlab), while I wanted to try the same excercises in Python.
I will probably enrich and expand upon the course original content in time, so that in the future these notes might diverge substantially from it.
